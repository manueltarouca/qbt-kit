A complete, typed Python client for the qBittorrent WebUI API — with a CLI that
covers every endpoint one-to-one, and an MCP server so coding agents can drive
it without deleting your data.

  <i>The ledger is generated from qBittorrent's own source, and CI fails if it slips.</i>

## Highlights

- **All 123 endpoints** of qBittorrent 5.2.3, each one a spec entry that
  generates the client method, the CLI command and the docs together.
- **A verifiable coverage claim.** The endpoint list is extracted from the
  qBittorrent C++ source per release tag and committed, so CI fails both when
  the spec misses an endpoint and when it invents one.
- **An MCP server** with 15 tools — 13 task-shaped, plus `qbt_call` and
  `list_endpoints` — and safety gates that hold even through the escape hatch.
- **Compatibility measured, not assumed** — tested against real 4.6, 5.0, 5.1
  and 5.2 containers, with a rename table so `torrents/stop` resolves to
  `pause` on servers that predate the rename.
- **Typed throughout**, no runtime dependency beyond `httpx` and `typer`.

That coverage claim is worth a sentence of context. The wiki page most clients
are written against documents **78** endpoints. qBittorrent 5.2.3 ships
**123**, and two whole scopes — `torrentcreator` and `clientdata` — appear in
no wiki page at all.

## Installation

PyPI's `qbt` name belongs to an unrelated package, so the CLI is run via
`--from`:

```sh
uvx --from qbt-kit qbt doctor
uvx qbt-mcp --help          # the MCP server ships under its own name
```

Or add it to a project:

```sh
uv add qbt-kit              # library and CLI
uv add "qbt-kit[mcp]"       # with the MCP server
```

## Quickstart

```sh
qbt doctor                          # version, auth mode, endpoint availability
qbt torrents info --category tv     # the API calls this `info`, not `list`
qbt torrents add --urls <magnet> --category tv --auto-tmm
qbt health                          # swarm health across the queue
qbt coverage                        # the endpoint coverage ledger
qbt call torrents/pieceStates -p hash=<h>    # raw, reaches all 123
```

Scope commands mirror the API exactly — `torrents info`, not a friendlier
`list` — so anything you read in qBittorrent's own docs translates directly.
`--json` works everywhere, so every command composes with `jq`.

`qbt ready` is also there, but it inspects the local filesystem to decide
whether a download has really settled, so it only means anything when the CLI
runs on the same machine as qBittorrent.

## MCP server

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qbittorrent": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["qbt-mcp", "--url", "http://127.0.0.1:8080"]
    }
  }
}
```

Fifteen tools rather than 123 — a tool list that long costs context
on every turn and measurably worsens which tool a model picks. `qbt_call` keeps
every endpoint reachable and `list_endpoints` lets a model discover them, so the
small surface stays complete.

### Configuration

Flags first, then the environment, then the macOS Keychain:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `QBT_URL` | base URL, default `http://127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `QBT_API_KEY` | API key (qBittorrent 5.2+); preferred when present |
| `QBT_USERNAME` | WebUI username, for cookie login on any version |
| `QBT_PASSWORD` | WebUI password |
| `QBT_READ_ONLY` | `1`/`true`/`yes` to refuse everything that changes state |

Keychain fallback uses service `qbittorrent`, account `api-key` for a key and
`webui` for the password:

```sh
security add-generic-password -s qbittorrent -a api-key -w '<key>'
```

**qBittorrent has no OAuth**, so there is no token flow to delegate and the
secret is long-lived. The reference MCP servers put credentials straight into
the client's `env` block — `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the canonical
example — but that file is plaintext and frequently committed. Prefer the
Keychain, and if you do use `env`, reference a variable instead of pasting the
secret:

```jsonc
"env": {
  "QBT_URL": "${QBT_URL:-http://127.0.0.1:8080}",
  "QBT_API_KEY": "${QBT_API_KEY:-}"      // empty falls through to the Keychain
}
```

The `:-` default matters. Claude Code passes an unset `${VAR}` through as the
*literal text* `${VAR}` rather than as empty, which otherwise surfaces as a
confusing 401 much later — so `qbt-mcp` detects that case at startup and says
so plainly instead of starting.

On startup it reports, on stderr, where the credentials came from and never
what they are:

```
qbt-mcp: http://127.0.0.1:8080 · WebAPI 2.15.1 · auth=bearer via macOS Keychain
```

### Safety

An agent driving a torrent client can destroy data that took weeks to collect,
so the gates are code rather than guidance:

- Destructive endpoints require `confirm`; `delete_files` is never implied.
- `--read-only` (or `QBT_READ_ONLY=1`) blocks mutations, **including via
  `qbt_call`**.
- `app/setPreferences` refuses the WebUI, auth and network keys that would
  sever the connection or weaken security. There is no override.
- Refusals return a structured cause and remedy, so an agent can correct itself
  instead of seeing an opaque tool error.

`qbt-mcp` speaks stdio by default, which keeps it a child process with nothing
listening. The `sse` and `streamable-http` transports expose an
*unauthenticated* control surface holding your qBittorrent credentials — bound
to loopback, but do not forward those ports. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Field notes

Things that cost us time, documented so they cost you none.

- **Login success cannot be read from the status code.** qBittorrent ≤5.1
  answers a *failed* login with HTTP 200 and the body `Fails.`; 5.2 returns an
  empty 204. The only rule that holds across versions is whether a session
  cookie was issued.
- **`app/webapiVersion` requires authentication.** Only `auth/login` is public,
  so you cannot read the version to decide how to authenticate. Probe instead.
- **The session cookie is not always `SID`.** On 5.2 it is `QBT_SID_<port>`;
  on 5.0/5.1 it is user-configurable. Never match on the name.
- **A bare 401 is often Host-header validation, not bad credentials.** It is on
  by default and rejects any request whose `Host` port differs from the port
  qBittorrent listens on — which is what happens behind mapped container ports,
  SSH tunnels and most reverse proxies.
- **API keys exist only from qBittorrent 5.2.0.** Sending `Authorization:
  Bearer` to 5.0/5.1 gets a 403 that looks like a credentials problem.
- **`pause`/`resume` were removed in 5.0**, not aliased; they 404 there.
- **`progress: 1.0` does not mean every file is on disk.** Progress is computed
  over the *selected* files, so a torrent with files at priority 0 reports 100%
  having never fetched them. `size < total_size` is the cheap flag, from the
  same listing call.
- **A category alone does not place a torrent.** qBittorrent only applies a
  category's save path under automatic torrent management, so `torrents/add`
  with a category but without `autoTMM` files it in the global save path.
- **A stalled torrent is usually not slow but stuck.** `availability` is how
  many complete copies exist across reachable peers; when it does not exceed
  `progress`, no peer has the missing pieces. But a *queued* torrent reports
  availability 0 simply for not being connected — judging those as dead is how
  you delete healthy downloads.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: endpoints are added
to the spec under `src/qbtkit/spec/`, never by hand to the CLI or MCP, and
`tools/build_coverage.py --strict` has to stay green.

  coverage claim, not because anything is wrong with it.
