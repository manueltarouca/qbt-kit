"""MCP server: task-shaped tools over the qBittorrent WebUI API.

Why not one tool per endpoint: there are 123 of them, and a tool list that long
costs context on every turn and measurably degrades which tool a model picks. So
the surface is 13 tools written for what someone actually wants to do, plus
`qbt_call` as the escape hatch that keeps every endpoint reachable.

The safety gates live in `Client`, not here, so `qbt_call` cannot bypass them —
destructive endpoints need `confirm`, `--read-only` refuses anything mutating,
and the `app/setPreferences` lockout keys are refused outright.

  QBT_USERNAME    WebUI username, for cookie login on any version

qBittorrent has no OAuth, so there is no token flow to delegate and the secret
is long-lived. Prefer the Keychain: an MCP client's config file is plaintext and
frequently committed. If you do use the `env` block, reference a variable rather
than pasting the secret:
